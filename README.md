# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application, that suggests clothing based on the current temperature in your city. The backend is an Express project that uses mongodb for the database. An API is created with routes that allow for clothing items and users to be added, edited, and deleted from the database.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
